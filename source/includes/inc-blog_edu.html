				<p>While on assignments leading global experiential organizations, developing accredited courses, and producing award-winning commercial branding campaigns for educational clients around the world- over the course of a decade, numerous excerpts have been compiled into the following: </p>

				<p>Flying across the sea, assigned to produce a documentary film in the remote areas of ancient Sanskrit Buddhas and Bon Shamans, we find no glass skyscrapers, cell phone selfies, nor wifi hot-spots. The fleeting moment of travel breathing life with every hilltop overcome, every smack of palm leaf to face, misty-eyed learners absorbing elements of experience that could never be instituted by way of powerpoint or projector. </p>
		
				<p>Jumping out of the idling jeep, just 6 Kilometers from a Nomadic school in the Far East of Ladakh, with Gyaltsen, our Ladakhi translator, and international exchange students studying traditional living and alternative energy utilization in the rural Himalayas; we disembarked for the small settlement lying a few hundred metres ahead.</p>

				<p>The culmination of the need for new generations of Nomads to be able to compete in today's educational standards, and the allure of the newly formed world of convenience has created an influx of Nomadic refugees into cities like Leh (the capital of Ladakh), and surrounding settlements like Choglamsar.</p>

				<p>Standing mid conversation with a leather faced Ladakhi man, he’s trying to explain to us why Bob Dylan’s “Blowing in the Wind” is the greatest American rock song. We give the typical half nod of India – whether it means yes or no, we still have not the slightest inclination. As our heads return to their balanced position between aching, arching shoulder blades, we spot a golden reflection off in the vast distance. </p>

				<p>Trying to remain unbiased to these effects of modernization and globalization, it’s similar to when we studied television's impact in Bhutan.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>"When home, I watch twelve hours (of TV) a day in the summer," said Dawa, a 19 year-old, second-year computer student. "This is not uncommon for children my age. The television has even caused problems between our family members over what programs to watch."</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Interviewing college students from Sherubtse College in Bhutan, we asked about how television had changed the country since its arrival in 2001. The most common answer was that it had greatly impacted the people of Bhutan. Back in Ladakh, we found similar answers to slightly different situations.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>"We have a problem in the Nomadic way of life," states Dolma, a mother living in a Nomadic region of Ladakh. "Our children go to school to get educated, but they either do not complete their studies, and become laborers in the city, or if they succeed they don't come back." </p>
				</blockquote>
