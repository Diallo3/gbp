				<p>While on assignments leading global experiential organizations, developing accredited courses on Media Literacy, Cultural Visual Media, and Buddhism, and directing/ producing award-winning commercial branding campaigns for educational clients in remote areas of the world- over the course of a decade, numerous excerpts have been compiled into the following:</p>

				<p>Day 7: Traversing 1600 km in seven days, planning eighteen months for this moment; defining identity for key stakeholders, developing strategic direction, identifying countries of interest, and sourcing tickets, all for the unknown of the story and the potential the challenge has to change the narrative.</p>

				<p>Looking back we think aloud, “Why do we go out and search stranger’s faces for portraits, why the need to harness simplicity for otherwise convoluted messages? Why can’t we sleep if we haven’t created for a purpose?”</p>

				<p>We remember what it means to be human, the means to tell a story; a video camera does not distinguish the integrity of one’s life narrative, nor does a neutral density filter block out the cliché jargon of the past twenty years of advertising. Seeking adventure, reigniting the child in us all, sourcing creativity while shining a light through the current media marketing landscape; that’s why we’re here.</p>

				<p>Formulaic analytics drives our world, and by measuring attention in impressions and ‘likes’, we simplify the process of creation. Myopathy found in the ‘templatation of data’ and the passé nature of customization, never has it been so primed for a world of personalization. </p>

				<p>We don’t do tourism branding... we climb up the mountain, write this copy on birchbark, then [re]brand through the human experience. A late night photo and video shoot in a remote and very serene valley led us to our moment of clarity.</p>

				<p>Documenting some of the finest traditional weaving, traveling around the world for a story you believe in- that’s impactful. It's not about branding or advertising, analytics or search engine optimization; it's all for the moments you hadn’t planned for. It's all for the instant you stop the scroll, and appreciate life. </p>

				<p>Rugged rural roads revolve this planet, and we search for the stories that we’re drawn to inherently.</p>

				<p>Day 8.</p>

						<p><small>Tourism Branding is simple; nights sleeping in far-reaching areas of remote towns in effort to scout the perfect location for the state campaign, the crunch-time studying of remote languages, the cultural agility to find the local subjects that exemplify what authenticity means to the country, while having as small of an external influence as possible...right? </small></p>
						
						<p><small>Travel with care, express the purpose that connects both parties. Far beyond the photo, we found the pre-production, conceptualization, help, luck, and serendipity, simply in the connection.</small></p>
