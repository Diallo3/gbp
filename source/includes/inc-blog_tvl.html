				<p>While on assignments leading global experiential organizations, developing accredited courses on Media Literacy, Cultural Visual Media, and Buddhism, and directing/ producing award-winning commercial branding campaigns for educational clients in remote areas around the world- over the course of a decade, numerous excerpts have been compiled into the following:</p>

				<p>The road was barely lit as we bumped corner to corner inside the small Maruti. Traveling from the ancient ruins sitting high overlooking the Paro valley, the sun setting, a waning reminder of the impermanence of our stay here and the gravitas of the decreasing light. The freedom of the fleeting moment and the beauty of every turn, an adrenaline laden injection for the traveler’s soul.</p>

				<p>A last glimpse, beauty on the hillside. The Himalayas giving us one more defining moment, embracing our liminal stay and our eternal desire to stay. She looks up as the sun peeks behind the Goliath peak and time stands still, a tension transferred; the last photo of the day. </p>

				<p>Surrounded by the calls of Himalayan Pashmina Goats, analytics far from the measure of success, we threw our arms around the old man and humbly felt smiles unravel from dusty lips. Our translator snapped a photo and we gave thanks, then departed from the Nomadic settlement. </p>

					<p>"Education is very important now-a-days. It is difficult to keep the Nomads Nomadic," says Tsering Phuntsok, a 67 year-old Nomad with 300 sheep and goats, and 30 yaks. "The children are greatly affected when they see TV, cars and modern life. It creates a desire for them. I’m upset at the balance of education and the Nomadic way of life. If a family has enough children then maybe they can continue this lifestyle."</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Leaving our computers behind - in effort to understand the repercussions education’s created in the Nomadic world - we headed far from the urban noise of Delhi: </p>

				<p>[Strategic Embedded Market Research]: out of thirteen eleven-year olds whom questioned where they would like to be in the future, ten - over three quarters of them- stated that they wanted to live in Leh, or another city. Half stated they had parents who already had left the Nomadic life, and moved towards a more convenient life in the urban areas.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>"The children used to come back to see the family for vacation from school, but today they don't come back," states Phuntsok. "I’m not happy with the children not coming back. We need the educated ones to come back and help our traditional Nomadic roots. Then maybe I can be happy."  </p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>We often contemplate the effect we have on the world around us, but how was it that education could be to blame for an increase in Nomadic family disruption? It wasn’t until travel made us reimagine what we considered to be concrete, did we see how multi-faceted life and education truly are. </p>
